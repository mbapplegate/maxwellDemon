## Story
Quantum physics is weird. Waves and particles, cats that are both dead and alive. What's behind it all? Turns out it's demons. These mischevious buggers switch light from waves to photons, entangle electrons, and can't help but murder or save every cat they see. But before they can be set loose on the world, they need training. If one of them started messing with classical physics, someone might figure out what they're up to and the whole jig would be up. 

Play as trainee quantum demon Maxwell as he tries to escape a series of rooms by proving he knows enough classical optics to avoid getting caught.
